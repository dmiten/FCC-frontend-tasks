## Build a JavaScript Calculator
  
**_Objective:_** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA).

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**_User Story:_**
- I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.<br>
